*Gods are a fundamental part of the dimensions and planes that make up existence.

*While they do represent fundamental pieces of the natural universes, not every piece of the universe has a god to represent it. More on this, many gods don't represent whole pieces of the natural universes but subdivisions of it. (For example, you could look at time. While one god could represent all of time, there could be multiple gods representing time. Perhaps one for passing time and one for present time.

*Many gods have found a solution to the problem of not having a god to represent everything. This solution being to either make gods by procreating with already existing gods, or appointing mortals to the position of god by marrying and most often having sexual intercourse with them. We refer to both of these types of gods as **'[[Mythical Gods]]'** as opposed to the usual term **'[[Non Mythical God]]'**.

*All Gods except for those who were originally mortal are capable of completely changing the shape of their body

*In most cases the already existing gods teach the mythical gods how to harness the power that they have gained though on occasion Mythical Gods are left on their own, not understanding their own power and very rarely ever understanding how it works before millennia have already passed.
