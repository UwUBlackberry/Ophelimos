*There were two lands long ago, [[Submissia]] and [[Dominatus]]. Both were cursed by the [[Gods]]. [[Submissia]] was cursed so that all it’s citizens would be bottoms, and [[Dominatus]] so that all their’s would be tops. The curses were not equal though.
In [[Dominatus]] when people would have sex they both would want to dominate the other, so while it would be a constant struggle for supremacy the sex would still happen. In [[Submissia]] however both parties want to be dominated, but the other wouldn’t act on that because they wanted the other too, thus sex in [[Submissia]] was practically impossible. 

*When [[Submissia]] was on the verge of dying out due to lack of births their queen decided to venture across the bast distance between her land and [[Dominatus]]. If she could take back enough of the people of [[Dominatus]], or even just enough of their fine water said to turn bottoms into tops with a sip, her people could be saved.
Alas, the gods had cursed these nations for their amusement, and so the disruption of the curse was not allowed. Elysium threw down at the queen challenge after challenge to try to stop her but she continued despite them. Eventually, when she was only one more day away one of the gods themselves descended onto the earth to stop them. The god told the queen her work was futile, but the queen would not stop until her people were saved. 

*She fought valiantly, but could not overcome the deity. She died, and with her her kingdom.
