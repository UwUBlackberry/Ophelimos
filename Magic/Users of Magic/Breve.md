****Breves** are essentially [[Magicians]] who decide instead of learning, understanding, and memorizing the fundamentals of [[Magic]], they inscribe magical equations on objects (Typically some form of paper), allowing them to cast spells with less training. However, these spells are most commonly less powerful than the typical magician.
