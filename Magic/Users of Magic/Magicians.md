 [[Magicians]] gain magic through their own studies, meaning that they usually only get the magic that they were researching. On rare occasions though, they find magic only seen by choice gods (Referred to as [[Godly Magicka]]) by researching multiple different types of magic at the same time, and on even rarer occasions, some have been known to become as powerful as gods by gaining a type of magic never before seen. These people usually become [[Mythical Gods]] in name but sometimes a god will lend them their power to make them truly gods.
