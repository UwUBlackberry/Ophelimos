Shadow [[Magic]] is a [[Note]] that allows for spells that can do things such as make the user become a shadow to hide places (Editors note: The more I look at this the more I realize it's definitely used for Voyeurism), create and control shadows and sometimes make them capable of picking up objects, and straight up sending people to the fucking shadow realm by having a shadow eat a person. (More on that last one below.)

*While [[Space]]/[[Portal]] magic is the magic that usually allows for travel between dimension, Shadow Magic is the only form of magic that allows for travel to and from [[An Oir]], a realm said to be on the edge of existence covered in shadows.
