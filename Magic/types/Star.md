Star [[Magic]] is a [[Note]] that allows the user to harness the powers of the stars themselves. While this [[Note]] can be similar to both [[fire]] and [[space]] in a few different ways. It's both powerful and controlling, but it's also capable of healing and creation. For example, you can seal wounds with a spectral galaxy effect, you can entirely recreate a lost arm, and heal a body that was cut in half or even decapitated if you're quick enough.
