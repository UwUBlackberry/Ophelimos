*Octaves are Notes that use the essence of an already existing magic type and have a more specific use.
With some types of [[Magic]], most people who use that type of magic can only use a specific subtype of that magic. (For example: Most people who know [[Death]], don't actually know [[Death]]. They know one if it's sub-types, i.e. [[Necromancy]], [[Hemomancy]], etc.)
