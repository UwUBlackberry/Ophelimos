Gold Blood is the blood of [[Gold-Bloods]] born with a more powerful type of magic.

Many magic users in many realms believe that drinking golden blood could make their magic more powerful and even extend their lifespans, though [[Modern]] technology and methods have shown that if this does work it's such a small increase that it's not detectable.
