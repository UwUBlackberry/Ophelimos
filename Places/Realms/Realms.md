*Realms are essentially different worlds connected to each other made by the original few [[Gods]] through some form of ancient magic. While this ancient magic isn't really, 'understood' by even most [[Gods]], some stronger [[Magic]] users can create portals to these other realms, sometimes even making these portals permanent. In some realms, cities are built around permanent portals for convenience.
